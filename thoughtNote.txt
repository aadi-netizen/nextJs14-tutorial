****************** Errors: ****************** 


1. Error type is not assignable to ReactNode type
----------------------------------------------------------
Reason: Occurs when You are trying to use the Error object inside the JSX, which is not a ReactNode. React is only expecting ReactNodes inside JSX. Such as String, Array of ReactNode, JSX, number, null, undefined etc.

Resolution: Use "The error object's properties such as message, name etc inside the JSX.
